###bob-fiji-plugins

These are [fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji) plugins written and maintained by [Robert Cudmore](http://robertcudmore.org).

This documentaiton is NOT done.

I am happy to fix bugs and make improvements to these plugins, just drop me an email.

If you use these plugins for your work, I ask that you give me credit. If that is not possible, an email is always nice.

###Installation

Download a .py file and copy the file into your Fiji plugins folder. If the plugin doesn't work, first thing is to try and use an older [lifeline version of Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Downloads). I would suggest 'Fiji Life-Line version, 2013 July 15'.

####bAlignBatch

Uses [MultiStackReg v1.45](http://bradbusse.net/downloads.html) to align a folder of .tif files. Has options to align on 1 channel and apply alignment to the other channel.
