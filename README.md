###bob-fiji-plugins

These are [fiji][1] plugins.

This documentaiton is NOT done.

I am happy to fix bugs and make improvements to these plugins, just drop me an email.

If you use these plugins for your work, I ask that you give me credit. IF that is not possible, an email is always nice.

###Installation

Download a .py file and copy the file into your Fiji plugins folder. If the plugin doesn't work, first thing is to try and use an older version of Fiji, the lifeline version is available [here][2]. I would suggest 'Fiji Life-Line version, 2013 July 15'.

####bAlignBatch

Uses [MultiStackReg v1.45][3] to align a folder of .tif files. Has options to align on 1 channel and apply alignment to the other channel. 

####Batch Convert To 8bit

Convert a folder of .tif files to 8-bit.

####Sliding Z-Projection

Convert an image stack (opened in Fiji) to a sliding Z-PRojection. What is a sliding Z-Projection? See [here][4].
